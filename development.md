# The development process 

### Here I will write a little about the development process of this project.

As a one man team (a single person doing everything) I do things MY way! And the code here in this repository may not always be "up to date", because I only update the GitHub repository (sync my local changes) every now and then (whenever I feel like it).

> Since I'm not working with a team it serves me no purpose to waste too much time and energy messing with the Git version control system (I don't have much experience with it either).

Also I'm not very interested in "team coding" yet. Since this project is still in a "puppy stage" it's best that I finalize it (stabilize the code structure and the engine design) a bit more before it makes sense for other people to contribute much to it?

And btw, I'm chronically sick and my life is currently very difficult, hence development might progress slowly. We'll see... Feel free to [sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/JoakimCh) to help me and my family out!

### Things I don't like:

* TypeScript, just forget it!
* Any kind of "build system" (because this project doesn't need it).
* Config files of development tools polluting the repository. ðŸ¤®
* Empty lines all over the place...
* Any tools for syntax rules or code beautifying; my code is art and you don't fucking mess with art!!
* Most JavaScript / TypeScript frontend developers! ðŸ¤£
* Mutants.

## Well, that's it for now!

Take care mate!
