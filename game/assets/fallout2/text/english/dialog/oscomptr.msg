{100}{}{You see a computer terminal.}
{101}{}{You see the voice interface terminal.}
{102}{}{You see a standard computer terminal, modified for voice commands.}
{103}{}{You examine the computer terminal, but cannot find anything obviously wrong with it. What do
 you do?}
{104}{}{Hit it in that 'special' way.}
{105}{}{Kick it in that 'special' spot.}
{106}{}{Run the diagnostic program.}
{107}{}{Open it up and look inside.}
{108}{}{Leave it alone.}
{109}{}{You gaze at the console for a while and decide upon the best spot to place a punch. After giving
 it your best 'this'll fix it' hit, the monitor flashes a couple of times and then stabilizes. There is
 no other effect.

What do you do?}
{110}{}{Kick it in that 'special' spot.}
{111}{}{Run the diagnostic program.}
{112}{}{Open it up and look inside.}
{113}{}{Leave it alone.}
{114}{}{This well-known repair method produces two results. First, the monitor seems to go haywire for
 several seconds and then stabilizes. Second, you hear a breaking metal type of sound and the panel you
 kicked falls to the floor. What do you do?}
{115}{}{Run the diagnostic program.}
{116}{}{Damn thing's open. Might as well look inside.}
{117}{}{Leave it alone.}
{118}{}{You are certain that the system should have a set of diagnostic routines available. However, the
 keyboard input seems to have been disabled. The unit accepts voice commands only. What do you do?}
{119}{}{The only thing left is to look inside.}
{120}{}{Leave it alone.}
{121}{}{Peering into the mass of cables and circuit boards, you find that the system has been deliberately sabotaged.
 One of the circuit boards, the voice recognition module, is beyond repair and must be replaced.
 Now all you need to do is find a replacement module.}
{122}{}{Done.}
{123}{}{Done.}
{124}{}{You install the module in the terminal. The system is repaired.}
{125}{}{The terminal needs a voice recognition module installed before it can become operational.}
{126}{}{Done.}
{127}{}{The system is working fine now.}

{128}{}{Accessing security footage, loading holographic playback...}

{129}{}{You are the last, Gruthar. The stain of your kind will soon be wiped clean.}
{130}{}{You tell your so-called President that he will burn for this.}
{131}{}{Whatever. You were never anything more than a talking animal.}
{132}{}{That may be, but we were created through your experimentation. Your gave us life!}
{133}{}{And now I give you death.}
{134}{}{Take his body. The doctor wanted a specimen.}
{135}{}{Their blood will run like the Nile!}
