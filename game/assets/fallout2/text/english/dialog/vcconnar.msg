{100}{}{You see a dirty but strong-looking man.}
{101}{}{You see Connar.}
{102}{}{Hey you! What are you doing!}
{103}{}{Stay where you are for now, wanderer. What are you doing here?}
{104}{}{I'm killing off the monsters here.}
{105}{}{Why, what's it to you?}
{106}{}{Why you Yell!}
{107}{}{I bet those bastards at Vault City sent you. Well you best be off, and leave everything else
 alive.}
{108}{}{Well, it's a little late for that.}
{109}{}{Why?}
{110}{}{Sorry, I have a job to do.}
{111}{}{Those creatures are the only thing that are stopping Vault City from making us their so-called
 servants.}
{112}{}{Well they're paying me to get rid of the monsters, and that's what I'm going to do.}
{113}{}{They didn't tell me that.}
{114}{}{They're paying me to get rid of them, and the job's done.}
{115}{}{You idiot! Why the hell did you do that!}
{116}{}{I needed the money.}
{117}{}{They'll come for us if you do that, you know.}
{118}{}{Not my problem.}
{119}{}{Well I hope you choke on it. They'll be here for us soon.}
{120}{}{I didn't know this was why they wanted the job done.}
{121}{}{Yeah, well, I don't deal with trash like you anyway.}
{122}{}{Well, we can't let you do that.}
{123}{}{You gotta do what you gotta do.}
{124}{}{You believed them at face value?  You've a lot to learn about the world, friend.}
{125}{}{Is there anything I could do to help?}
{126}{}{The Vault City boys aren't the bravest. You show them any kind of a fight and they run for the
 hills. If we had a few guns, I think we could hold them off.}
{127}{}{What sort of guns?}
{128}{}{Well, I'm good with a shotgun, and we have some people in here that can handle a rifle. I think
 three of those would do.}
{129}{}{I'll see what I can do.}
{130}{}{You're not wanted here. Leave now.}
{131}{}{I changed my mind. What can I do to help?}
{132}{}{Yeah, well, you're not going to be here for long anyway.}
{133}{}{Like I care.}
{134}{}{You're back! Do you have the guns for us?}
{135}{}{What was it that you needed again?}
{136}{}{Yep, here they are.}
{137}{}{We need three rifles and a shotgun. The sooner you can get them to us, the better.}
{138}{}{Okay.}
{139}{}{With these, we'll be able to make something of this place over the next months. If you ever need
 a place to rest, you will always be welcome here.}
{140}{}{You're welcome.}
{141}{}{Welcome back. Things are going well. We're going to work on expanding the Village.}
{142}{}{Hello again! Things have been going well, as you can see. Look around if you have the time.}
{143}{}{We're still building. We're hoping to expand the walls again in the next month.}
{144}{}{Greetings! The village has expanded again as we have hoped. You are welcome as always.}
{145}{}{We have nothing to fear from Vault City any longer, and will be able to live here in peace.
 Thank you again, wanderer.}
{146}{}{Just don't kill anything out there, you simpleton.}
