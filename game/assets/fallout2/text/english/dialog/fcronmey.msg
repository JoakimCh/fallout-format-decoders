{100}{}{You see someone wearing a captain's hat.}
{101}{}{You see Captain A. Ron Meyers}
{102}{}{You see a punk in tattered clothes wearing a captain's hat.}
{103}{}{What the hell do you want? I don't speak to anyone unless they're friends or good people. Do something for one of my buddies and then come talk to me.}
{104}{}{-done-}
{105}{}{I heard what you did for my men. Thanks. What can I help you with?}
{106}{}{You who?}
{107}{}{I hear you're the one who knows all about this ship.}
{108}{}{Why do they call you the Captain?}
{109}{}{How do you get this thing to go?}
{110}{}{Nothing.}
{111}{}{I'm the Captain. I run the ship. Any more questions, go talk to one of the Shi or Badger or someone. I don't have time for you.}
{112}{}{-done-}
{113}{}{This ship's a Poseidon tanker. It's equipped with tech that lasted through the war. It's got a FOB that allows access to the navigation computer room, and it's got an IFF transponder that protects it from Poseidon guns.}
{114}{}{How do you know all this?}
{115}{}{What's an IFF transponder?}
{116}{}{How do you get it to go?}
{117}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{118}{}{I used to serve with the Enclave. Then I realized it wasn't the USA I was fighting for; it was for the rich old bastards who didn't want to give up their power. I deserted and now I live here with more honest people.}
{119}{}{More honest people? These guys?}
{120}{}{What exactly is the Enclave?}
{121}{}{How do you get this thing to go?}
{122}{}{Bye.}
{123}{}{How do you pilot this rig? Fill 'er up with some gas - try the Hubologists or the Shi after you've taken care of everything else - and press the button. The computer will take care of the rest, if it's still working. It'll sail right out to the oil rig, and they won't fire at you because you've got the IFF transponder. Just make sure you've got what you need to access everything: FOB, working computer, and fuel. Easy enough, huh?}
{124}{}{Sure. How do you know all this?}
{125}{}{What's an IFF transponder and a FOB?}
{126}{}{What oil rig?}
{127}{}{Yes. Bye.}
{128}{}{IFF: Identify Friend or Foe. It means that this ship is identified as a friend, so other Poseidon things - like, say, an oil rig - won't fire at you when you come into range.  Oh, and a FOB is some sort of Enclave technology that let's you enter a door electronically.  You'd probably find one of them at one of their bases or some such place.}
{129}{}{How do you know all this?}
{130}{}{What oil rig?}
{131}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{132}{}{Yes. With these people, you know exactly where you stand. They don't play games. The Enclave was like a pack of hyenas - they'd turn on you in a second.}
{133}{}{What exactly is the Enclave?}
{134}{}{How did you hook up with them?}
{135}{}{The Enclave is remnants of old times. If you take this thing across the water to the rig, you'll find out for yourself.}
{136}{}{How do I pilot it?}
{137}{}{What rig?}
{138}{}{Easy enough. I just left the Navarro base one day and headed down here. I figured it was the last place anyone would look. Besides, I'm not important enough for the Enclave to look for me - I'm just a loose end.}
{139}{}{What exactly is the Enclave?}
{140}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{141}{}{There's a big Poseidon oil rig left out on the water. That's the final base of the Enclave, and unless I miss my bet, that's where your friends are, too.}
{142}{}{How do you know all this?}
{143}{}{What else is going on out there on the rig?}
{144}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{145}{}{Word gets around.}
{146}{}{I see. What else is going on out there on the rig?}
{147}{}{I see. Bye.}
{148}{}{Beats me. I was a Navarro tech, not a rig operator. We talked to them over the comm lines, and that was about the extent of it.}
{149}{}{I see. How do I pilot this again?}
{150}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{151}{}{You made a bad mistake messin' with the Captain and his friends...}
{152}{}{How do you pilot this rig? Well, I see you already gassed her up. When you've taken care of everthing else, just press the button. The computer will take care of the rest, if it's still working. It'll sail right out to the oil rig, and they won't fire at you because you've got the IFF transponder. Just make sure you've got what you need to access everything: FOB, working computer, and fuel. Easy enough, huh?}
{153}{}{Oh, yeah. You gotta get the navigation computer working as well.  I bet you'd find parts for it in one of those old vaults.}
{154}{}{Good to see you again. What do you need?}
