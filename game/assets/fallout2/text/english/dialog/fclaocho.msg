{100}{}{You see a man who looks much like a shopkeeper.}
{101}{}{You see Lao Chou, the shopkeeper.}
{102}{}{You see a man in functional, comfortable clothing.}
{103}{}{Greetings! Welcome to my shop, Flying Dragon 8.}
{104}{}{What can I do for you?}
{105}{}{Da aggle oo!}
{106}{}{Stuff!}
{107}{}{Who are you?}
{108}{}{I'm looking for some equipment.}
{109}{}{I'm looking for some information.}
{110}{}{Bye.}
{111}{}{You want to buy something?}
{112}{}{::nod head::}
{113}{}{::shake head::}
{114}{}{This is what we have, then.}
{115}{}{- end -}
{116}{}{Well, I'm afraid that's all I can do for you. Good day.}
{117}{}{-done-}
{118}{}{I'm Lao Chou. I run this establishment, Flying Dragon 8, a general store. I have been known to trade in... information.}
{119}{}{What sort of information?}
{120}{}{I see. I'd like some equipment.}
{121}{}{Little happens in this town that I do not know about. Of course, you must know the right question to ask, yes? What do you need to know?}
{122}{}{I'm looking for some upgrades to my equipment.}
{123}{}{Where can I find vertibird plans?}
{124}{}{I need to find fuel for the PMV Valdez.}
{125}{}{I understand I need a FOB to access the Valdez' computer.}
{126}{}{I need some computer parts for the PMV Valdez.}
{127}{}{I'm looking for a spleen.}
{128}{}{I hear some flying machines brought a load of villagers down this way.}
{129}{}{Nothing. Bye.}
{130}{}{Talk to Crocket, over in the Hubologist camp. He is their head scientist.}
{131}{}{Thanks. I want more information.}
{132}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{133}{}{Look to the north, in Navarro. There is a hidden base near the gas station.}
{134}{}{Thanks. I want more information.}
{135}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{136}{}{Have you tried looking in the old Vaults? I hear that they are a wealth of information and technology of the ancients.}
{137}{}{Thanks. I want more information.}
{138}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{139}{}{A spleen? Ha ha! Yes, Chip from the Valdez lost his spleen in a card game the other day. I sold it to Dr. Wong.  He was fascinated by it.}
{140}{}{Dr. Wong? Where can I find him?}
{141}{}{How do you lose a spleen?}
{142}{}{Thanks. I have more questions.}
{143}{}{Ah, so. Bye.}
{144}{}{Dr. Wong is the head scientist in the Steel Palace. Seek him there.}
{145}{}{How do you lose a spleen, incidentally?}
{146}{}{Thanks. I want more information.}
{147}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{148}{}{He was drunk. Very, very drunk. He was obsessed with his spleen all night long. And then he bet it.}
{149}{}{So you took his SPLEEN?}
{150}{}{I see. Well, I have more questions.}
{151}{}{Yes. It was a debt. He is an honorable man.}
{152}{}{I see. I need more information.}
{153}{}{You're a sick, rude bastard, aren't you?}
{154}{}{Right. Bye.}
{155}{}{You are a dishonorable person. I will not have you in my shop. Come back some other time.}
{156}{}{Whatever.}
{157}{}{They did not. They came from the north and flew over us, heading out over the sea.}
{158}{}{Over the horizon? How the hell do I get there?}
{159}{}{Yeah, right they did. Tell me where they are before I open you like a can of sardines.}
{160}{}{Well... none of our boats are capable of that kind of distance.  Unless...}
{161}{}{Unless...?}
{162}{}{Thanks for your "help". I'm going to get me some real advice.}
{163}{}{... unless you can get the old tanker on the docks working. It's an old ship, but probably still functional, if some work is put into it. Ask the punks for more information.}
{164}{}{Thanks. I want more information.}
{165}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{166}{}{Word has it that the Hubologists have come into a large quantity of fuel recently. Bargain with them.}
{167}{}{Thanks. I want more information.}
{168}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{169}{}{You might try some of the Shi scientists in the Steel Palace. Perhaps they can help you with your fuel needs.}
{170}{}{Thanks. I want more information.}
{171}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{172}{}{You are an enemy of my people. Die!}
{173}{}{You have performed well for my people in slaying AHS-9. I hope that I can be of assistance to you in some way.}
{174}{}{Who are you?}
{175}{}{I'm looking for some equipment.}
{176}{}{I'm looking for some information.}
{177}{}{Bye.}
{178}{}{You have already given them to the Hubologists. No?}
{179}{}{Oh yeah...ah...Can I ask something else?}
{180}{}{Oh yeah...Bye.}
