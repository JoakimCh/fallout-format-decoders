{100}{}{You see a bored person dressed in leather armor.}
{101}{}{You see (x), the caravan guard.}
{102}{}{You see a dusty, bored person wearing leather armor. From the brahmin stench and the confident
 walk, this person is clearly a caravan guard.}

{103}{}{Can I help you with something?}
{104}{}{Urg?}
{105}{}{Ny work here!}
{106}{}{Who are you?}
{107}{}{What can you tell me about Chad?}

{108}{}{I got no patience for idiots. Sorry, pal, but you’ll have to find someone else to play with.}
{109}{}{::sniff::}

{110}{}{I’m (x). I’m one of the caravan guards.}
{111}{}{What can you tell me about Chad?}
{112}{}{Thanks. Bye.}

{113}{}{Chad’s a good guy. Tough, but fair. Lavish with his rewards for those of us who work well. }
{114}{}{Who are you?}
{115}{}{Thanks. Bye.}

{116}{}{Thanks. No, really. Thanks for screwing up our bonuses. The only people Chad was hurting were
 the people we traded with; he was helping us out, and you screwed that up. Loser.}
{117}{}{Bye.}

{118}{}{It’s the enemy! Die!}
{119}{}{Oops.}
