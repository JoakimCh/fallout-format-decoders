# More about the "game engine"

Currently it's developed together with the game, but as things mature I will separate it into its own directory.

Also currently its implementing a [2D canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D) rendering engine (for simplicity), but I might also implement a [WebGL2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL2RenderingContext) rendering engine at a later point, if it's needed (performance wise or capability wise).

> A 2D canvas based engine is actually a good thing because it's much easier for most people to understand and co-develop (and results in a much cleaner code).

I'll write more here later...
